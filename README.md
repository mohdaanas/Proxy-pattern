Proxy Pattern

A very simple example can be illustrated by Bluetooth connectivity, which restricts few devices access. The proxy first checks the available devices you are connecting to, if it is not part of restricted site list, then it connects to the real Bluetooth. This example is based on proxy pattern. 

In the program list of arrays of devices are written the proxy checks the available device which we want to connect if the devices match's which we want to connect then then it will connect to real Bluetooth class.
